PrusaSlicer Update Smoothes Out 3D Prints

Good news for local 3D printing enthusiasts: PrusaSlicer has released an update that addresses Variable Fine Artifacts (VFAs), leading to smoother prints with fewer surface imperfections. This development is a significant step forward for the entire 3D printing community, promising higher quality results from your prints. While specific pricing for software updates isn't usually a concern for users, the accessibility of this fix through PrusaSlicer makes advanced print quality achievable without extra cost for existing users. This update means you can expect better finishes on your models, which is always a welcome improvement.

In other tech news, Xbox Game Pass subscribers have a new lineup of games coming, including the highly anticipated *Hollow Knight: Silksong*. This addition is a big draw for gamers looking for quality titles without the hefty individual purchase price, a consideration that resonates well with budget-conscious consumers here in Singapore. Meanwhile, *Helldivers 2* players can celebrate the defeat of the formidable Hive Lord, a massive in-game enemy that required significant coordinated effort, including ten in-game nukes, to overcome. This highlights the ongoing, dynamic nature of online gaming experiences and the community effort involved in tackling challenges within games.
