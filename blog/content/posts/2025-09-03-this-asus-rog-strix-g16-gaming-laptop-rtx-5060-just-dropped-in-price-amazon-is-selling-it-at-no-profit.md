ASUS ROG Strix G16 Price Cut: Should You Grab It?

It's rare to see a brand-new gaming laptop drop in price so soon after launch, but ASUS's ROG Strix G16 with an RTX 4060 is doing just that. Amazon is reportedly selling it at no profit, signalling a significant price cut. This move could be a strategic one from ASUS to either clear inventory or to make the powerful Strix G16 more competitive in the current market.

For gamers in Singapore, this kind of deal is always worth looking into. While the source doesn't mention local pricing, a substantial discount on a laptop with an RTX 4060 could make it a compelling option compared to similarly specced machines. The RTX 4060 is a capable GPU for 1080p and even some 1440p gaming, and if ASUS Singapore follows suit with aggressive pricing, it might just become the sweet spot for many local enthusiasts looking for performance without breaking the bank. We'll need to see how local retailers like Challenger, Harvey Norman, or even official ASUS stores price this model to determine its true value here.

Given the aggressive pricing strategy mentioned, if you've been eyeing a new gaming laptop with a solid GPU, keep an eye on the ROG Strix G16. The potential savings could be substantial.
