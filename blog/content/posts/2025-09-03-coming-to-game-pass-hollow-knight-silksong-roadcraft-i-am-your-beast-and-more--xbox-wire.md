Game Pass Gets Big Names, Perfect Dark Stalls

Xbox Game Pass is beefing up its library for September, with the highly anticipated *Hollow Knight: Silksong* leading the charge. This indie darling's arrival on Game Pass is massive news for subscribers, offering a compelling reason to keep their membership active. Alongside *Silksong*, players can expect *RoadCraft* and *I Am Your Beast* to join the service, providing a mix of genres for a varied gaming experience. For Singapore gamers, the value proposition of Game Pass continues to be strong, especially when major titles like *Silksong* are included day one. The local pricing for Game Pass remains competitive, making it an attractive option for accessing a broad range of games without individual purchases.

In other industry news, the troubled *Perfect Dark* revival project has hit another snag. Talks between Take-Two and Embracer for publishing the game reportedly fell through. This development casts further doubt on the future of the reboot, which has been in development hell for some time. For a market like Singapore, where players are often eager for new AAA experiences, this kind of news is disappointing. The lack of progress on *Perfect Dark* means it's unlikely to be a contender for our consoles anytime soon, if at all.

Meanwhile, some familiar faces from Polygon have launched a new venture under the name "Rogue." While not directly impacting Game Pass or console releases, it signifies the ongoing evolution of game journalism and content creation. It's a reminder that the industry is dynamic, and new platforms and voices are always emerging.

For now, the focus for many will be on *Hollow Knight: Silksong*'s Game Pass debut. It’s a solid addition that demonstrates Game Pass’s commitment to bringing high-quality titles to its subscribers. If you're a fan of challenging Metroidvanias, this is definitely one to look forward to.
