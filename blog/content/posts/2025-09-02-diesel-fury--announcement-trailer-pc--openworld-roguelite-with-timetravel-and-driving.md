Solo Dev Drives Open-World Roguelite with Time Travel

A new PC title, *Diesel Fury: Outgun the Universe*, is in the works, developed by a solo programmer. This open-world roguelite promises a blend of driving and time-travel mechanics. The developer is actively seeking feedback and wishlists on its Steam page, indicating a desire to gauge player interest before a full release. [SOURCE 1]

While details are still emerging, the concept of an open-world roguelite isn't new, but the inclusion of time-travel adds a unique twist. For Singaporean gamers, the appeal might lie in the potential for fast-paced action combined with strategic replayability, hallmarks of the roguelite genre. However, without information on pricing or specific release windows, it's difficult to gauge its immediate impact on the local market. Given the solo development, we can anticipate a more focused, perhaps niche, experience. It will be interesting to see if the time-travel element is a gimmick or a core gameplay loop that can keep players engaged across multiple runs.

For those intrigued by the premise, checking out the game's Steam page and YouTube channel is the best way to stay updated and show support. [SOURCE 1]
